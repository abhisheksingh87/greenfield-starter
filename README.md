This **greenfield-app-starter** helps you to develop a spring boot microservice based on **Non-Reactive** or [**Reactive**](https://blog.redelastic.com/what-is-reactive-programming-bc9fa7f4a7fc#reactive) techniques.
* you can use the **Non-Reactive** path for migrating a _legacy application_ to a cloud-ready microservice.


* we recommended the **Reactive** path for _greenfield applications_, to take advantage of the non-blocking behavior that improves application performance and resiliency.

The **Application Starter Cookbook** provides recipes to help complete the tasks required to build a fully functional spring boot microservice.
