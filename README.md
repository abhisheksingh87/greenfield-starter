The application starters will help Wells Fargo developers to create _non-reactive_ or _reactive_ microservices based on the business need:
- **greenfield-app-starter** for migrating a _legacy application_ to a cloud-ready microservice.
- **greenfield-reactive-app-starter** for _greenfield applications_, to take advantage of the non-blocking behavior which improves application performance and resiliency.

Both the app starters share a common tech stack, comprising components approved for use within Wells Fargo.
