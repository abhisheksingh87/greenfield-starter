**Guard rails** over the starters

- how fast can I create a ready to deploy _plain vanilla_ application with some predefined functions

  (Persistence, Messaging, Caching, healthchecks, metrics, Logging, Tracing, Reactive etc...)

- property driven configuration w/o knowing the underlying functions

- Through recipes start creating the _business functionality_ using the ready to run barebone app

- Confined functions with _predefined configurations_
